### SwiftUI Tutorial

This is the entire tutorial, you will be responsible for all of it eventually
but for this assignment, you are responsible only for the other things immediately
below.

[Apple's Swift UI Tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/#swiftui-essentials)

For this assignment you need to go through the following:

1. [Creating and Combining Views](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/creating-and-combining-views)
2. [Handling User Input](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/handling-user-input)

In particular for this assignment we are going to be using Buttons, VStacks, 
HStacks and Lists so you will want to review their documentation

1. [Views and Controls](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Views-and-Controls)
2. [Layout and Presentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view-layout-and-presentation)

### The Swift Composable Architecture (TCA)

We are going to architect our app using an open source framework called TCA. My 
lectures will focus mainly on this with reference to the above SwiftUI elements.

To understand TCA, you need to understand Effects and State. Effects are really a different take on the way I've taught Combine:

1. [Effects, Part 1](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep80-the-combine-framework-and-effects-part-1)
2. [Effects, Part 2](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep81-the-combine-framework-and-effects-part-2)

And these videos show the use of the the entire architecture:

2. [TCA Part 2](https://www.pointfree.co/collections/composable-architecture/a-tour-of-the-composable-architecture/ep101-a-tour-of-the-composable-architecture-part-2)
3. [TCA Part 3](https://www.pointfree.co/collections/composable-architecture/a-tour-of-the-composable-architecture/ep102-a-tour-of-the-composable-architecture-part-3)
4. [TCA Part 4](https://www.pointfree.co/collections/composable-architecture/a-tour-of-the-composable-architecture/ep103-a-tour-of-the-composable-architecture-part-4)

### Optional Readings:

A big app written with TCA that you can explore:
